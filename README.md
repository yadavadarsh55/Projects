# Projects

## Commited all the files, which are :
### main.py :
#### Has the Real_time video capturing, face detection and passing the face region to the pre_trained model in the train_model.py
### train_model.py :
#### Contains the code foe the Deep Learning Model using the CNN(Convolution Neural Network), predicting the emotion on the face region. However the accuracy is low (almost 63%) and i wanna improve it.
### test_model.py :
#### Contains the code for the model evaluation and model testing using the Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
